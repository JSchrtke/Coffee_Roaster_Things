General features:
    display current temperature (live)
    display time-temperature-plot without recording
    create reference profile
    load reference profile
    display a menu
    start roast:
        displays the current temperature
        draws plot of given reference profile
        draws plot of current roast live
        saves data of current roast to file
    control roaster temperature based on reference profile
    manual roast
        keeps temperature constant until new target temperature is given

Rough program flow:
    0.: program start
    1.: set up temperature probe
    2.: display current temperature
    3.: display time-temperature-plot without logging data
    4.: display menu
        4.1: option 1: load reference profile
        4.2: option 2: create reference profile
        4.3: option 3: start roast
        4.4: option 4: exit program
    5.: stop and exit program

Detailed flow step by step:
    1.: set up temperature probe
        1.1: import neccessary libraries
            1.1.1: import the Phidget22 Phidget library
            1.1.2: import the Phidget22 TemperatureSensor Device library
            1.1.3: import the Phidget22 Exception library
        1.2: define the on_attach_handler
            1.2.1: create variable that holds and instance of the TemperatureSensor object
            1.2.2: set the device serial number given by user
            1.2.3: set the channel number given by user
            1.2.4: set the temperature change trigger
            1.2.5: set the data polling interval
        1.3: define the on_temperature_change_handler
            1.3.1: create a variable that holds the current time
            1.3.2: create a variable that hold the current temperature
            1.3.3: send current time and temperature to the RoastProfile class via one of it's
                   member methods
        1.4: set the attach handler to the previously defined method
        1.5: set the temperature change handler to previously defined method
        1.6: attach the temperature probe
            1.6.1: tell the user you are trying to attach the temperature probe
            1.6.2: open the channel and wait for the attachement event
            1.6.3: if the attachement is successfull, tell the user it was
            1.6.4: if the attachement failed, tell the user it failed
            1.6.5: tell the user you are retrying to attach the probe
            1.6.6: retry up to 3 times
            1.6.7: if still not successfull, tell user the program needs to be restarted
            1.6.8: terminate the program
    2.: Create a class RoastProfile
        2.1: create variable to store the temperature
        2.2: create variable to store the current time
        2.3: create variable that stores whether or not the data given to the class needs to be
             logged or not
        2.4: create list that stores the temperature data when it is logged
        2.5: create list that stores the time data when it is logged
        2.6: create initialization method for the class
            2.6.1: create a variable that holds the name of the current roast profile
            2.6.2: create a variable that holds the path where the current roast profile should
                   be saved
        2.7: create method to get the temperature and time from the on_temperature_change_handler
            2.7.1: if the data needs to be logged, append it to the lists for storing time and
                   temperature
        2.8: create method to save the time and temperature data lists to file
            2.8.1: open the file where the profile should be saved using the variables set by the
                   initialization method
            2.8.2: write each value in the time and temperature data lists to file
            2.8.3: save the image of the time-temp-plot to the same location
        2.9: create method to import a reference profile
        2.10: create method to create a reference profile
    3.: display the current (live) temperature
        3.1: Open new window (this can perhaps be a subplot added to the temperature live plot)
             to display the temperature
        3.2: Display the temperature stored in the RoastProfile class member variable
